- GET example with option v:
curl -k -v -X GET 'https://someserver.com/' -H "Accept:application/hal+json" -H "Accept-Language:en-US" -H "Cache-Control:no-store" -H "Content-Type:application/hal+json"
		- flag k for the https and to ignore the SSL certif warning.
		- flag v for verbose. It makes the operation more talkative. You can replace v with i to only get headers and body.
