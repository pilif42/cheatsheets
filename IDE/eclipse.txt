- To debug with LEDR:
               - edit D:\ORACLE\mw11g\user_projects\domains\ledr_local\bin\startWebLogic.cmd
                                             - at line 78, add: call setDomainEnv.cmd

               - edit setDomainEnv.cmd and add at line 136 the below:
                                             set debugFlag=true
                                             set DEBUG_PORT=8453
                                             set PRODUCTION_MODE=false

               - in Eclipse, Run menu, Debug Configurations, Remote Java Application and New:
                                             - choose a Name
                                             - in the Connect tab:
                                                                           - choose a project (lerp-ui)
                                                                           - Connection Type = Standard (Socket Attach)
                                                                           - Connection Props: localhost & 8453
                                             - in the Source tab:
                                                                           - add projects for which you will want to debug the code.
                                             - Apply & Close.
											 
               - rebuild the app from the latest code and redeploy to Weblogic: important as otherwise the debug hook with the code in Eclipse may not synch exactly.
               - verify http://localhost:7050/lerp/login.xhtml is up.
               - in Eclipse, start the debug config created above and this should hook up with your WebLogic.
