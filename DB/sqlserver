- Query for clustering:
Using Microsoft SQL Server, a possible implementation for server-side clustering of points on a map could
use a query such as:

select count(1),
  (((geometry::ConvexHullAggregate(location)).STBuffer(0.00001)).STCentroid()).STAsText(),
   (geometry::ConvexHullAggregate(location)).STAsText(),
   round(location.STX, 1) as x,
   round(location.STY,1) as y
from error_omission
where error_reference > 54
group by round(location.STX, 1), round(geom.STY,1)

This rounds the X and Y coords and aggregates points with the same coords together, giving us collections
of points by a grid. We can change the grid, making it smaller by increasing the integer in the round
function (number of decimal places). From the collection, we draw a Convex Hull around the points (a point,
 line or polygon that encloses all the points with convex curves only). We buffer that shape to ensure it
 is a Polygon and obtain the Centroid point.

Note that the where clause is because the location for entry 54 seems to cause the convexHull to return null.
